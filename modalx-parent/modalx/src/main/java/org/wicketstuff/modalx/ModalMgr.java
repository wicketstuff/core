/**
 * Class Name : ModalMgr Diagram : Wicket Generic Modal Windows Project : Echobase framework Type :
 * interface Manages the allocation and deallocation of modal windows. An application implements
 * this method (typically in a base Page class) and provides for 'n' modalWindows. The markup for
 * that base class should include the appropriate number of modal window &lt;divs&gt;. For example if the
 * maxumum depth of modal windows was n = 2 then the base class markup should have:
 *
 * &lt;div wicket:id="modalWindow_0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div wicket:id="modalWindow_1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 *
 *
 * and the constructor of the ModalMgr implementor should contain code like this:
 *
 * // Establish the ModalWindows
 *
 * modalContentWindows = new ModalContentWindow[MAX_MODALS]; for (int m = 0; m &lt; MAX_MODALS; m++) {
 * ModalContentWindow modalWindow = new PbModalWindow(this, "modalWindow_" + m, true);
 * modalWindow.setInitialWidth(600);
 *
 * modalWindow.setInitialHeight(400);
 *
 * body.add(modalWindow);
 *
 * modalContentWindows[m] = modalWindow;
 *
 * }

	/**
	 * Notifies the ModalMgr of that a ModelContentWindow is about to show.
	 * The method can perform work like setting the markup variation to be used for the ModalContentPanel
	 * via a call to ModalContentPanel.setVariation(String), among other things
	 *
	 * NOTE: This method replaces the old trackModalVisit(IWicketModalVisit) method as that was very specific
           * to tracking and there are more things that are likely to be required than just visit tracking so the name
           * and parameter was changed.
	 * To implement previous trackModalVisit behaviour call modalContentPanel.createModalVisit(); and do
	 * whatever you previously did with the IWicketModalVisit object that was created
