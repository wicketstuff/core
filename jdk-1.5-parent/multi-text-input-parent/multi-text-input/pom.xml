    <name>Multi-Text Input</name>
    <description>
        The WicketStuff Multi-Text input is a Javascript widget which mimics
        the To: input in Apple's Mail.app, or the &gt;fb:multi-friend-input&lt;
        input from Facebook.

        Essentially, the user may type a piece of text into the input then hit the
        enter key to have the text added to the input in a rounded box.  The user
        may delete the texted entered by either clicking on an x button within the 
        rounded box, or hitting the backspace button to highlight the text, then clicking
        backspace again to delete it.

        Two sets of hidden inputs are used to keep track of the text added to the input
        and the text deleted.
