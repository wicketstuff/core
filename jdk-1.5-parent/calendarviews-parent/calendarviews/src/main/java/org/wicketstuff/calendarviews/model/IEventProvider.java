/**
 * The main data-locator interface between your service or data access layer and CalendarViews. Note
 * that it is at its heart a standard Wicket IModel&lt;Collection&lt;? extends IEvent&gt;&gt;. It
 * only adds a single method so that the CalendarViews layer can initialize it to the proper date
 * range needed.<br />
 * <br />
 * <b>NOTE: </b> Read the documentation on the <tt>initializeWithDateRange</tt> method carefully. It
 * is important to understand the difference between the dates that you initialize your calendar
 * with and the dates that the calendar will initialize your <tt>IEventProvider</tt> with.

	/**
	 * Called by the calendar view when it has computed what the actual start and end dates of the
	 * range that it will be displaying are. This is necessary, for example, because you may
	 * initialize the calendar view with a range of Wednesday through a Thursday, but depending on
	 * the type of view that it is, it may show from the Sunday prior to your start to the Saturday
	 * after your end.<br />
	 * <br />
	 * Note that the end time is exclusive. Therefore, if the calendar is displaying Sunday through
	 * Saturday, the start date will be Sunday at 00:00:00.000 and the end date will be the
	 * following Sunday at 00:00:00.000<br />
	 * <br />
	 * Also notable is that you need to remember to include not only events that begin within this
	 * range, but also events that begin before, but end within this range. i.e. your query may be
	 * like:<br />
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * 	where (start > :start and start < :end)
	 *    or (end < :end and end > :start)
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * @param start
	 *            The first instant that the calendar will display, inclusive
	 * @param end
	 *            The last instant that the calendar will display, exclusive
