/**
 * This example re-uses almost everything from the tab example to show you how simple it
 * is to just replace the strategy. The effect we are trying to create is that the regular
 * user now has all the power of the super user and vice versa. Offcourse there are
 * simpler ways for doing that but then we would not have an example about using a custom
 * strategy now did we?
