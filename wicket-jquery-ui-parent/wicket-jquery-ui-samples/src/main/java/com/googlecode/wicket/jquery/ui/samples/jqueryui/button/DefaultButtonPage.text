The <code>Button</code> class inherits from <code>org.apache.wicket.markup.html.form.Button</code>.<br/>
It means that you can use a button exactly as built-in Wicket one, except that it looks like the jQuery one.<br/>
<pre>
Button button = new Button("button1") {

	@Override
	public void onSubmit() {
				
	}			
};</pre>
