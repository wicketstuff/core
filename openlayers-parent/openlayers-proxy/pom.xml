	<name>Openlayers - Proxy</name>
	<description>For Web Feature Service Requests a Proxy needs to be used.  The need for a proxy is due to browser cross site scripting restrictions.
	It is separated from the main package due to its dependency on commons-httpclient and because it is only needed for WFS or WMSGetFeatureInfo requests.
