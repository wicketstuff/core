		This is a page which is going to be cached via ServiceWorker.<br>
		If you shutdown the server this page will continue to be available if the user has accessed it before with a browser which supports ServiceWorker. 
		It might behaves a bit strange but if you want to update the cache you have to:
		<ol>
			<li>Close all tabs that accesses the web application</li>
			<li>Stop the server and change the unique cache identifier in the Application</li>
		</ol>
		This behavior is wanted because you don't want to pull the rug out from under the browsers feet and to prevent inconsistent results, because a renewed javascript file might not fit to the actual page.
		You have to close all tabs because this stops the old ServiceWorker and if you access the page again the new one is load.<br/><br/>
		To test the cache here are server side generated ids:
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div style="font-weight:bold;">
		This is a span with a generated UUID (on server side) <span wicket:id="id"></span><br/>
		This is a span with a generated UUID set via javascript - id is generated server side <span id="scriptId"></span><br/><br/>
		</div>
		<div style="width:500px">
		It is important that you think about the browser cache! So if a javascript file is cached from the browser it might not be requested, 
		even if your application is reachable and the unique cache name has been changed. 
		The cache for this application has been disabled so that you always get a server response.<br/><br/>
		
		You are able to access the service worker in crome via chrome://serviceworker-internals/<br/><br/>
		
		If you leave your browser open during the restart a second request has to be made, 
		because even if you switch between the windows on your desktop device, 
		chrome for example makes a fresh request to update thumbs.
