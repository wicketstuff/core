Provides an <code>AjaxButton</code> which pop-ups an OK-Cancel confirmation dialog when clicked. In case of confirmation, the form is sent via an ajax post.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note: </b> this component is not an <code>AjaxButton</code> itself but a <code>Panel</code>, it should not be attached to a &lt;button /&gt;; it can be attached on a &lt;div /&gt; or a &lt;span /&gt; for instance.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Warning: </b> it is not possible to get a form component value - that is going to be changed - to be displayed in the dialog box message. The reason is that in order to get a form component (updated) model object, the form component should be validated. The dialog does not proceed to a (whole) form validation while being opened, because the form validation will occur when the user will confirm (by clicking on OK button). This the intended behavior.
