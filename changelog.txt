Previously there was a changelog file where developers were encouraged to edit with the details of what they had committed.

With the transition to git it is easy to get a quick summary be developer of the work done between two versions.

e.g. git shortlog wicketstuff-core-1.4.17..wicketstuff-core-1.4.17.1
will show the changes between these two tags in a format like:

user.name (# of commits):
	first line of first commit
	first line of the second commit
	...
	first line of the nth commit

Please use a suitable first line that will be informative to the user.  Think about including the module that the change relates.
