		<h2>This is a modal.</h2>
		<p>
			Reveal makes these very easy to summon and dismiss. The close button
			is simply an anchor with a unicode character icon and a class of
			<code>close-reveal-modal</code>
			. Clicking anywhere outside the modal will also dismiss it.
		</p>
		<p>Finally, if your modal summons another Reveal modal, the plugin
			will handle that for you gracefully.</p>
