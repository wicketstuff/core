	<p>
	You can use the Include component to include arbitrairy content from non-Wicket locations,
	such as static HTML headers, or even do page integration from external sites.
	</p>
	<p>
	This component is not used for normal page composition tasks.
	You should usually get by using Panels, Borders and Markup inheritance.
