    <p>
	    This page was loaded by a component specific override. You can use that - with care - if you have
	    to implement custom loading strategies that are very local to the component. For instance, a custom
	    component that loads it's template from a database and for which you don't want the application
	    to have to know about it's differing loading resource.
    </p>
    <p>
	    This example loads the custom template just once, though it may reload when resource polling is
	    turned on and the template changes. If you want a load the template every time a page (or panel)
	    is requested, you can additionally let your container implement IMarkupCacheKeyProvider, and then
	    return null in the implementation of getCacheKey; Wicket will not cache templates without a
	    cache key. This functionality can be used to e.g. when you want to load templates from a database,
	    and you know that the actual templates can be different from request to request.
